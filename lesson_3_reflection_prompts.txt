When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When I want to cooperate with others to finish a big project, or when I want to share my project with other people, I would use a remote repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because the remote repository would change due to others' modifications which I might do not want to be applied to my local repository.
